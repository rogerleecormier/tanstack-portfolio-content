I use AI where it creates **real, measurable value** — accelerating delivery, reducing manual toil, surfacing risks earlier, and generating compliance evidence automatically.  

Unlike hype-driven adoption, my AI approach is **pragmatic, governed, and outcomes-focused**. I position AI as a **collaborator, not a replacement**, embedding copilots into development and operations in a way that scales with auditability.

## 🧭 AI Practices

- **Vibe Coding (Cursor + Copilot)**  
  Conversational, iterative coding with AI copilots — scaffolding, refactoring, and documenting code in real time.  

- **Agentic Development**  
  Treating AI copilots as *autonomous collaborators*: proposing architectures, generating test coverage, enforcing standards, and logging rationale in PRs.  

- **AI in Operations**  
  Asana AI for status reports and risk surfacing; anomaly detection in ERP/AP pipelines; scheduled exports and dashboards.  

- **AI at the Edge**  
  Cloudflare AI Workers for classification, summarization, and lightweight inference at the request boundary — enabling real-time, low-latency automation.

## 📂 Representative AI Use Cases

### 📊 Asana AI for Status Reporting
- Automated executive updates summarizing project health, risks, and blockers  
- **Impact**: 70% reduction in prep time; risks surfaced earlier  

---

### ⚙️ Copilot + Codespaces for Serverless Scaffolding
- Used Copilot to generate Azure Functions templates, boilerplate code, and documentation  
- **Impact**: reduced build time from days to hours  

---

### 💳 Ramp AI Agents
- Embedded policy enforcement and anomaly detection in AP processes  
- **Impact**: prevented non-compliant spend before reconciliation; faster audits  

---

### 🌐 Cloudflare AI Workers
- Deployed Workers to handle text classification, summarization, and policy checks at the edge  
- **Impact**: near real-time responses for client-facing workflows

| Area                   | Before                  | After (My Work)            |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Status Report Prep     | Manual, time-consuming  | ↓ 70% effort with Asana AI |
| Serverless Prototyping | Days of manual scaffolding | Hours with Copilot         |
| AP Policy Compliance   | Reactive, post-facto    | Preventive with AI Agents  |
| Edge Automation        | Limited, centralized    | Real-time with AI Workers  |

## 🌟 Closing Thought

AI is not a replacement for human judgment — it’s an **amplifier of human capability**. When paired with governance, it makes delivery faster, safer, and smarter.
