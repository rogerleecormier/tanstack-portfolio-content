ERP and SaaS systems are the **backbone of enterprise operations**. But too often, they’re siloed, error-prone, and slow. I design and deliver **API-first, audit-ready integrations** that reduce manual effort, increase visibility, and produce compliance evidence automatically.  

My philosophy: **Interoperability → Validation at Source → Reconciliation by Design → Observability**.

## 🛠 Platforms & Tools

- **ERP Core** → NetSuite (GL/AP workflows, SuiteScript automation, saved searches)  
- **Finance & FP&A** → Ramp (AP, expense, procurement), Vena (forecasting), Checkbook.io (ACH)  
- **Collaboration** → Box (document standards), Smartsheet (orchestration), Asana (intake/workflow)  
- **Automation** → Azure Functions, Python, Power Automate, SuiteScript  
- **Edge & Web** → Cloudflare Workers/Pages (API orchestration), KV (cache), D1 (persistence), AI Workers (light inference)

## 🌟 Closing Thought

Integrations should feel invisible — users just see faster results, fewer errors, and reliable compliance.
