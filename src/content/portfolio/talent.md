Technology alone doesn’t scale organizations — people do. I apply **systems-thinking to workforce design**, creating structures and practices that grow capability, embed equity, and sustain high performance.  

I bring the discipline of a military leader and the empathy of a servant leader to design organizations that are **clear, inclusive, and future-ready**.

## 🧭 Talent Principles

- **Clarity of Roles** — eliminate ambiguity through documented responsibilities and outcomes  
- **Leadership Pipelines** — structured mentorship and coaching pathways that accelerate readiness  
- **Feedback Systems** — normalize feedback loops across teams, projects, and leaders  
- **Equity & Inclusion** — build frameworks that reduce bias in hiring, promotion, and evaluation  
- **ROI on Talent** — align workforce planning with measurable outcomes (delivery, retention, engagement)

Great organizations don’t just hire talent — they **design for it**. Structures, rituals, and feedback loops create cultures where people can thrive.
