Risk and compliance aren’t just checkboxes—they are **strategic enablers**. Done well, they reduce surprises, accelerate audits, and strengthen trust across stakeholders.  

My approach: **embed controls directly in the flow of work** so that evidence is produced automatically and governance feels like clarity, not bureaucracy.

## 🧭 Core Principles

- **Controls-in-the-Flow** — no after-the-fact checks; validations happen where data is entered  
- **Reconciliation by Design** — systems compare and confirm data before exceptions occur  
- **Governance as Accelerator** — risk surfaced early → fewer escalations later  
- **Military Precision** — Be • Know • Do applied to risk discipline: be clear, know the system, do the work right

## 🛠 Compliance Patterns

- ERP approvals aligned to budget authority & segregation of duties  
- NetSuite saved searches and formula-driven exception flags  
- Automated reconciliations (Ramp ↔ NetSuite, Box ↔ Vena)  
- SOPs and naming standards embedded in file and folder structures  
- Change control tracked in Asana/Smartsheet with decision logs  
- Lineage mapping and documentation auto-generated from workflows

## 📂 Case Studies

### 💳 AP Controls (Ramp ↔ NetSuite)
- Enforced GL mapping and validation during AP sync  
- Built approval workflows aligned to budget thresholds  
- **Impact**: fewer AP errors, faster audits, stronger compliance confidence  

---

### 📦 Forecast Intake Compliance (Box → Vena)
- Schema validation checks at the point of submission  
- Smartsheet dashboards tracking on-time and late entries  
- **Impact**: 50% fewer ingestion errors; 1-day faster forecast cycles  

---

### 📊 Financial Reporting QA
- Smartsheet-based timestamped reviews for report submissions  
- Exceptions flagged automatically for rework before ingestion  
- **Impact**: reduced missed reports, faster downstream processes

## 📈 Operating Metrics

| Metric                     | Before                  | After (My Work)           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Approval Compliance         | Ad hoc                 | 100% mapped to authority  |
| Reconciliation Errors       | Frequent downstream     | Exceptions flagged at source |
| Audit Prep Time             | Weeks of manual hunting | Evidence auto-delivered   |
| Forecast Error Rates        | High ingestion failures | ↓ 50% errors              |

## 🛡️ Compliance Domains

- SOX & audit readiness  
- Data integrity & lineage  
- Access & Segregation of Duties  
- Change management controls  
- Continuous monitoring & reporting
