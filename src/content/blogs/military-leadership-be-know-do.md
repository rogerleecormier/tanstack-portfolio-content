Leadership isn't a job title. It's a set of decisions made under pressure.

And in a world saturated with agile frameworks, AI copilots, and remote workflows, we need a model of leadership that's not just trendy—but timeless. That's why I continue to draw from a principle I learned in the military and apply it in every organization I work with:

## Be. Know. Do.

This simple leadership model, taught to every U.S. Army soldier, transcends industries, sectors, and roles. It's not about theory—it's about building leadership that endures.

## 🔰 What Is the Be, Know, Do Model?

At its core, this framework breaks leadership into three inseparable components:

*   **BE** — The character, presence, and values that define who you are.
*   **KNOW** — The knowledge, skills, and judgment that inform what you bring.
*   **DO** — The execution, influence, and initiative that define how you lead.

This isn't fluff. It's a tested formula used to develop leaders under the most demanding conditions imaginable. The military isn't alone in its need for resilient, ethical, and competent leadership—so is every modern organization operating at scale and speed.

## 🧭 Why It Still Matters—Especially Now

In today's organizations, we often over-engineer leadership with playbooks, certifications, or managerial dashboards. But when it really matters—during transformation, crisis, or disruption—what actually counts is:

*   Who shows up.
*   What they know.
*   What they do under pressure.

Be, Know, Do cuts to the core. Let's explore how to apply each element in real organizational settings—with actionable examples.

## 1️⃣ BE — Lead with Character Before Capability

Character is the leadership differentiator. When people don't trust your intentions, they won't follow your direction.

In organizations, BE manifests as:

*   **Integrity in decision-making**: Not inflating projections to please executives.
*   **Empathy in leadership**: Advocating for a team member's workload during a high-pressure launch.
*   **Courage in conversations**: Giving honest upward feedback, even when politically risky.

### ✍️ Example:

Imagine a team leader discovers that a platform upgrade inadvertently exposed customer data. Rather than hiding the issue or quietly fixing it, they advocate for disclosing the breach, explaining what happened, and outlining next steps transparently—even though it may damage short-term reputation.

This is "BE" in action—choosing principle over optics.

"BE" also looks like:

*   Defending a direct report under fire for honest mistakes.
*   Declining to inflate velocity metrics to impress leadership.
*   Admitting what you don't know and bringing in others who do.

> 🎖️ In high-stakes moments, it's not tools or templates that lead—it's trust.

## 2️⃣ KNOW — Stay Competent, Stay Curious

Leaders who stop learning start failing. Knowing is not just technical mastery—it's understanding your system, your stakeholders, and your blind spots.

In the workplace, KNOW means:

*   **Business fluency**: Understanding how your product affects customer retention and revenue, not just tickets or uptime.
*   **Cross-domain awareness**: Knowing how Legal, Finance, and Ops intersect with your tech roadmap.
*   **Tool and systems proficiency**: Learning that new CRM, AI tool, or scripting language before you're behind the curve.

### ✍️ Example:

A project manager joins a product initiative using tools and systems they haven't worked with before—perhaps Salesforce, Power Automate, or Azure DevOps. Instead of deferring decisions or remaining passive, they commit to learning those tools within the first sprint, attend demos, and proactively identify inefficiencies others have overlooked.

This is "KNOW" in action—bridging gaps through curiosity and initiative.

"KNOW" also includes:

*   Understanding how upstream changes affect downstream processes.
*   Having enough technical fluency to evaluate feasibility.
*   Staying informed on compliance, finance, and user impact—not just tech.

> 🧠 Great leaders aren't just subject matter experts—they're system thinkers.

## 3️⃣ DO — Act With Ownership and Urgency

Ideas are cheap. Execution is leadership. DO is where credibility is earned—not through delegation, but through visible ownership and impact.

In the modern org, DO looks like:

*   **Shipping despite uncertainty**: Getting a pilot out instead of waiting for perfect data.
*   **Driving clarity**: Creating a RACI matrix when no one knows who's responsible.
*   **Protecting delivery**: Clearing blockers and shielding teams from scope creep.

### ✍️ Example:

During a merger, confusion reigns over system ownership and project responsibilities. One individual—without formal authority—steps up to draft a consolidated project tracker, facilitates alignment meetings, and clarifies roles using a RACI model. Over time, their structure becomes the de facto coordination tool.

This is "DO" in action—leading through contribution, not control.

"DO" also shows up when:

*   You escalate blockers early and constructively.
*   You protect your team's time by absorbing stakeholder noise.
*   You choose delivery over perfection in fast-paced environments.

> 🎯 Execution is the loudest form of leadership—and the most visible.

## 🔄 The Leadership Loop: Why All 3 Matter

If you only "BE," you'll be seen as a nice person—but ineffective. If you only "KNOW," you may be seen as smart—but disconnected or arrogant. If you only "DO," you'll burn out—or burn your team out—without direction.

But when you lead through all three—BE, KNOW, and DO—you create a self-reinforcing loop of credibility, trust, and performance.

## 🔧 Applying the Framework to Organizational Initiatives

Here are practical ways to embed Be, Know, Do into real-world initiatives:

### 🎯 1. Digital Transformation
*   **BE**: Model transparency and humility when old systems fail.
*   **KNOW**: Understand not just the tools, but the pain points they solve.
*   **DO**: Drive change adoption through demos, trainings, and hands-on involvement.

### 🏗️ 2. Cross-functional Collaboration
*   **BE**: Build rapport beyond your silo.
*   **KNOW**: Learn each team's OKRs, workflows, and constraints.
*   **DO**: Align work across functions instead of escalating misalignment.

### 🌐 3. Remote or Hybrid Teams
*   **BE**: Be visibly present and supportive—even without proximity.
*   **KNOW**: Understand digital-first communication tools and rhythms.
*   **DO**: Follow up with clarity and celebrate wins intentionally.

### 🔥 4. Crisis or Change Management
*   **BE**: Stay calm and mission-aligned.
*   **KNOW**: Understand stakeholder fears and operational risks.
*   **DO**: Lead from the front—communicate early, often, and with purpose.

## 🏁 Final Word

Be, Know, Do isn't just a military philosophy. It's a human-centered leadership model that scales across environments. In a world demanding agility, resilience, and trust—it gives leaders a compass, not just a checklist.

Ask yourself daily:

*   **BE** – Who am I as a leader? What do I stand for?
*   **KNOW** – What do I need to understand to lead this moment?
*   **DO** – What actions am I taking to move the mission forward?

Whether you lead projects, teams, or entire organizations, this model builds trust, credibility, and performance—from the inside out.
