Products succeed when **users adopt them and organizations trust them**. My focus is on **translating operational pain points into service blueprints, MVPs, and adoption strategies** that make technology stick.  

I bridge **finance, operations, and engineering teams** with UX that is clear, measurable, and designed for sustainability.

## ✍️ Approach: Discovery → Definition → Delivery

1. **Discovery** → interviews, workflows, constraints, risk identification  
2. **Definition** → service blueprints (people × data × tools), data lineage maps, success metrics  
3. **Delivery** → MVP slicing, rollout playbooks, enablement, telemetry for adoption & ROI

## 📈 Product Success Metrics

| Area                | Before             | After (My Work)          |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Ramp AP Rollout     | Ad hoc, inconsistent | Phased, structured, faster adoption |

## 🌟 Closing Thought

Product success isn’t measured in feature count — it’s measured in **adoption, retention, and reduced toil**.
