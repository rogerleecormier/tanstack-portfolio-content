I engineer **DevOps pipelines that move fast without breaking trust**. My approach blends serverless architecture, AI-augmented workflows, and governance-in-flow so every deployment is **observable, auditable, and recoverable**.

---

## 🛠 Core Stack

- **CI/CD** → GitHub Actions (builds, deploys, linting, security checks)  
- **Serverless** → Azure Functions (ETL, API orchestration)  
- **Edge-Native** → Cloudflare Workers, Pages, KV (cache), D1 (SQLite persistence), AI Workers (inference)  
- **Frontend** → TanStack Router, React, shadcn/ui, TailwindCSS  
- **Automation** → Python, PowerShell, SuiteScript, Power Automate  
- **Observability** → App Insights, structured logging, rollback playbooks  

---

## 📂 Representative Projects

### 📦 Box → Vena ETL (Serverless)
- Replaced brittle batch jobs with Azure Functions + GitHub Actions  
- Added schema validation, retries, Key Vault secrets, App Insights logging  
- **Impact**: 75% fewer failures; retired legacy hardware; increased observability  

---

### 🌐 Vertex Hub (Edge-Native)
- Frontend: TanStack + shadcn/ui on Cloudflare Pages  
- Workers handle request routing + KV caching; D1 stores structured metadata  
- Unified service intake across Asana, Zendesk, ERP  
- **Impact**: Faster SLA responses, reduced manual routing, single-pane-of-glass experience  

---

### 💳 NetSuite ACH → Checkbook.io
- Designed native ACH workflow in NetSuite with SuiteScript + REST  
- Enforced GL/entity validation and logged all transactions for audit  
- **Impact**: Zero duplicate/misrouted payments; 100% compliant, hands-off uploads  

---

### 🛒 Retail POS Automation (Legacy)
- Built 30+ Python/PowerShell scripts for patching, deployments, log collection  
- Validated in a 50-VM staging lab before rollout to 150+ stores  
- **Impact**: 3× faster deployments; 40% fewer tickets; first-pass install ↑ to 95%

## 🤖 AI-Augmented DevOps

I integrate AI copilots directly into the SDLC:  

- **Vibe Coding (Cursor + Copilot)** → conversational code, config, and scripts co-created with AI  
- **Agentic Development** → AI copilots propose architectures, generate test coverage, detect edge cases, and log rationale in PRs  
- **AI Workers** → Cloudflare AI Workers run inference (classification, summarization) at the edge for low-latency workflows  

**Impact:** ~100 developer-hours/month reclaimed; faster prototyping; resilient pipelines with audit evidence baked in.

## 📈 DevOps Impact Metrics

| Area              | Before              | After (My Work)         |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Integration Failures | Frequent batch errors | ↓ 75% failures, +retry logic |
| Deployment Speed  | Hours to manual patch | 3× faster with CI/CD + scripts |
| AP ACH Process    | Semi-manual, error-prone | Fully automated, zero duplicates |
| SLA Response      | Disconnected intake  | Unified, tracked at edge |

## 🌟 Closing Thought

Velocity without **traceability** is vanity. True DevOps means **speed + evidence**.
