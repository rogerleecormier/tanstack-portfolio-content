Leadership is the through-line of my career. From leading **U.S. Army Signal Corps communication teams** under high-pressure conditions to orchestrating **enterprise SaaS and ERP transformations**, I bring the same principles of clarity, accountability, and results.  

My compass is the Army’s timeless **Be • Know • Do** model:  
- **BE** → Character and values: integrity, accountability, resilience  
- **KNOW** → Technical competence and judgment: fluency across systems, stakeholders, and methods  
- **DO** → Execution with urgency, clarity, and ownership of outcomes

## 🎖️ Military Roots: Be • Know • Do

As a Signal Corps Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO), I was responsible for **mission-critical communications and global readiness**.  

- **BE — Character**  
  Led by example, instilling integrity, resilience, and servant leadership.  

- **KNOW — Competence**  
  Mastered tactical networks (WIN-T), RF systems, and satellite comms. Directed **24/7 NOC operations** with 99.99% uptime.  

- **DO — Execution**  
  Built cross-functional teams capable of executing complex objectives under compressed timelines. Conducted after-action reviews (AARs) to codify lessons learned.  

**Operational Impact:**  
- Mission-critical comms deployed seamlessly across theaters  
- Network disruptions resolved in minutes, preventing mission delays  
- Mentorship pipelines increased certification pass rates well above baseline

## 💼 Civilian Leadership: Cross-Functional Delivery

In enterprise settings, I apply the same discipline to **ERP modernization, SaaS integrations, and digital transformation programs**.  

- **Program & Portfolio Leadership** — Scope, dependencies, RAID transparency, multi-team orchestration across Agile, Hybrid, and Predictive.  
- **Governance-in-Flow** — Approvals, validations, reconciliations embedded in NetSuite, Smartsheet, and Power Automate.  
- **Stakeholder Alignment** — Translating technical complexity into executive clarity and business outcomes.  
- **Culture Building** — Radical clarity, constructive challenge, feedback-driven growth.  

**Representative Outcomes:**  
- **Ramp ↔ NetSuite AP Governance** — reduced manual AP effort, stronger audit trails, faster close cycles  
- **Box → Vena Forecast Intake** — standardized submissions, schema validation, 50% fewer ingestion errors  
- **Financial Reporting QA** — Smartsheet-based review workflows, fewer missed submissions  
- **CI/CD Enablement** — hardened Azure + GitHub pipelines, faster deployments with rollback readiness

## 🌱 Leadership Philosophy

> *“Great leaders don’t create followers — they create more leaders.”*  

Whether leading a 24/7 military NOC or a cross-functional SaaS rollout, my philosophy is consistent:  
- **BE** grounded in values  
- **KNOW** with competence and curiosity  
- **DO** with clarity, urgency, and accountability

## 🌟 Closing Thought

Leadership is not a title — it’s a daily practice, expressed in decisions, behaviors, and results.  

> *“Leadership is measured not by authority, but by the trust, clarity, and growth you leave behind.”*
