Data without context is noise. I specialize in **turning fragmented operational data into actionable insights** that leaders can use to steer with confidence. My approach is to **embed analytics into daily workflows**, not silo them in slide decks — so risk is surfaced early and decisions are based on evidence.

## 🛠 Analytics Practices

- **Operational Dashboards** — live status views of SLA adherence, backlog aging, and reconciliation status  
- **Forecast & Financial Analytics** — NetSuite saved searches, Box→Vena ingestion checks, AP aging analysis  
- **Project Health Monitoring** — Asana AI surfacing risks in delivery velocity, deadline adherence, and blockers  
- **Governance Metrics** — risk registers, RAID dashboards, early-warning signals tied to project triggers

## 🌟 Closing Thought

Analytics should be more than reporting — it should be the **early warning system** that keeps organizations proactive, not reactive.
